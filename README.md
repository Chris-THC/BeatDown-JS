# BeatDrop-JS

A dumb script for just getting some got damned songs

This is just a wrapper around [deemix](https://deemix.app/), specifically around [deemix-js](https://git.freezer.life/RemixDev/deemix-js). it's main purpose is to serve as an easier, more accessible implements script to the deemix library.

it's intended use is for small groups of people to self-host, and as such there's barely any restrictions to the service and no "official" instance of it.

## usage

1. Enter your deezer ARL and copy into index.ts

   your arl can be found in the local storage for deezer, as a value conviniently named `arl`

2. You would type `npm install` and install all packages
   
3. You can run this proyect firts you type: `cd/src` and then type `node index.js`.
